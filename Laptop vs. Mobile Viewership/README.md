This is the same question as problem #3 in the SQL Chapter of [Ace the Data Science Interview](https://amzn.to/3kF79Fx)!

Assume you're given the table on user viewership categorised by device type where the three types are laptop, tablet, and phone.

Write a query that calculates the total viewership for laptops and mobile devices where mobile is defined as the sum of tablet and phone viewership. Output the total viewership for laptops as `laptop_reviews` and the total viewership for mobile devices as `mobile_views`.

### `viewership` Table

|Column Name|Type|
|---|---|
|user_id|integer|
|device_type|string ('laptop', 'tablet', 'phone')|
|view_time|timestamp|
